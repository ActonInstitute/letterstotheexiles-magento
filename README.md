# Magento Twitter Bootstrap SASS Theme

## Demo theme with Bootstrap and SASS

### Please Note
+ This theme is currently used at http://shop.letterstotheexiles.com
+ You may modify it to your branding and theme assuming you know SASS and basic Magento theming.
+ Letterstotheexiles.com does not theme every aspect of Magento, but most major account screens and checkout process has been skinned and modified for Bootstrap. This may affect how you use this theme and you'll almost certainly require further modifications.
+ For more template modes grab the layout and template files from Magento's base theme.
